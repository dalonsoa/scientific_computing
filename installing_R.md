# Instructions for installing R

Go to the [R-project website](https://www.r-project.org/) and download the latest version of R. Currently (2018-03-26), the latest and more stable version of R is [R v3.4.4](https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-3/R-3.4.4.tar.gz). If you click in the previous link, you will start downloading the zip file with this software. Please choose your preferred location to save this file (e.g. "C:/Program\ Files" for Windows users or "/User/Applications/" for Mac users) and unzip its content. You can unzip it with either with a specific software (e.g. Winzip, 7zip, etc.) or, if you are familiar and comfortable using the terminal, you can open a new terminal where this file has been saved and then type:

```bash
tar -xzf R-3.4.4.tar.gz 
```

Once you have R installed, we are going to install RStudio, a set of integrated tools designed to help you be more productive with R. Go to the [RStudio website](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) and download the FREE installer version. The current version (2017-03-26) is RStudio v1.1.442. Please download the correct installer according to your platform, i.e. Ubuntu, Windows, Mac OS X, etc.
Choose the location for the installer, execute it, and follow the default instructions to install it. The only thing that you will have to specify during the installation procedure is where you want R to be installed.

After that, just open RStudio and you are ready to use R! :)
