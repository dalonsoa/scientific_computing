## Good programming practice

As newcomers to the programming world, it is easier for you to start applying from your very first code a good programming practice as you do not have to remove bad programming habits. Therefore, we encourage you to read some tips we have learnt through our experience which have improved the quality of our coding and saved many hours of debugging. We hope you take your time to go through them and follow them from the very beginning. You will see that they are easy to understand, easy to remember, and easy to apply to your coding style :smile:

## Exercises

In the following links, you will find the exercises you started to work with during the practical part of the course. If you have any doubts about the solutions you have for the exercises or you have any questions, please post a new topic in the course mailing list you joined. Take into account that maybe you are not the only one having this specific question, so this is the most efficient way to keep track of all your doubts, answer them, and make the discussions available to all the attendees :smile:
