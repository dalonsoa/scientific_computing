## Good programming practice

As newcomers to the programming world, it is easier for you to start applying from your very first code a good programming practice as you do not have to remove bad programming habits. Therefore, we encourage you to read some tips we have learnt through our experience which have improved the quality of our coding and saved many hours of debugging. We hope you take your time to go through them and follow them from the very beginning. You will see that they are easy to understand, easy to remember, and easy to apply to your coding style :smile:
